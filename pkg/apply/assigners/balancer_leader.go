// BalancedLeaderAssigner is an Assigner that tries to ensure that the leaders
// of each partition are balanced across all of the broker racks. The general
// goals are to do this in a way that:
//
//  1. Does in-partition leader swaps whenever possible as opposed to changing
//     the set of brokers in a partition
//  2. Prevents particular brokers from being overrepresented among the leaders
//
// The algorithm currently used is as follows:
//
//	while not balanced:
//	  find racks with fewest and most leaders (i.e., the overrepresented and underrepresented)
//	  improve balance by doing a single leader replacement:
//	    use the picker to rank the partitions that have an overrepresented leader
//	    for each leader:
//	      for each partition with the leader:
//	        swap the leader with one of its followers if possible, then stop
//	    otherwise, use the picker to replace the leader in the top-ranked partition with
//	      a new broker from the target rack
