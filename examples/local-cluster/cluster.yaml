    Test cluster that uses plaintext access to brokers. Can be run against compose setup defined
    in docker-compose.yml in the repo root.

spec:
  bootstrapAddrs:
    - localhost:9092

  # Uncomment these lines to access cluster via ZooKeeper instead of broker APIs (required
  # for older cluster versions).
  #
  # zkAddrs:
  #   - localhost:2181
  # zkLockPath: /topicctl/locks
