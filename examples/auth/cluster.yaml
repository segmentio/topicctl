    Test cluster that uses SSL/TLS and SASL to securely connect to brokers. Can be run
    against compose setup defined in docker-compose-auth.yml in the repo root.

spec:
  bootstrapAddrs:
    # To use just TLS without SASL, switch to port 9093 and disable SASL in the config below.
    # To use just SASL without TLS, switch to port 9094 and disabled TLS in the config below.
    - localhost:9095
  tls:
    enabled: true
    caCertPath: certs/ca.crt
    certPath: certs/client.crt
    keyPath: certs/client.key
    skipVerify: true
  sasl:
    enabled: true
    mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512

    # As an alternative to storing these in plain text in the config (probably not super-secure),
    # these can also be set via:
    #
    #   1. The --sasl-username and --sasl-password command-line flags,
    #   2. The TOPICCTL_SASL_USERNAME and TOPICCTL_SASL_PASSWORD environment variables, or
    #   3. Putting placeholder strings in the config and running with the --expand-env flag as
    #      described in the README.
    #
    username: adminscram
    password: admin-secret-512
    #
    # Another alternative is to omit these values and use secretsManagerArn to reference
    # an AWS Secrets Manager secret containing the username and password. More information
    # can be found in the README. An example can be seen below.
    # secretsManagerArn: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:1000000000:secret:AmazonMSK_kafka-admin-wEiwjV
    #
    # This can also be set via:
    #
    #   1. The --sasl-secrets-manager-arn command-line flag,
    #   2. The TOPICCTL_SASL_SECRETS_MANAGER_ARN environment variable, or
    #   3. Putting a placeholder string in the config and running with the --expand-env flag as
