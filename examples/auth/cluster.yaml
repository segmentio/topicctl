    Test cluster that uses SSL/TLS and SASL to securely connect to brokers. Can be run
    against compose setup defined in docker-compose-auth.yml in the repo root.

spec:
  bootstrapAddrs:
    # To use just TLS without SASL, switch to port 9093 and disable SASL in the config below.
    # To use just SASL without TLS, switch to port 9094 and disabled TLS in the config below.
    - localhost:9095
  tls:
    enabled: true
    caCertPath: certs/ca.crt
    certPath: certs/client.crt
    keyPath: certs/client.key
    skipVerify: true
  sasl:
    enabled: true
    mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512

    # As an alternative to storing these in the config (probably not super-secure), these can be
    # set by using the --sasl-username and --sasl-password flags or the
    # TOPICCTL_SASL_USERNAME and TOPICCTL_SASL_PASSWORD environment variables when running
    # topicctl.
